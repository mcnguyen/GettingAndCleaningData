==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. 

Script Description
==================
The run_analysis.R script reads the UCI HAR data set in the data subdirectory to collect the avarages of the measurements as follow:
    1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
    2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
    5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject


For each record it is provided
==============================
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
- A 79 features with time and frequency domain variables.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean

Notes 
=====
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each row in the data set contains the averages of mean and standard deviation measurements of the above variables for each activity and each subject
