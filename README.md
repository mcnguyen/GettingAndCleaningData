# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
#### offered by Johns Hopkins University via Coursera

In this assigment I have created a script called 'run_analysis.R' that does the following:

1. Downloads the dataset from the following URL
        
        https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

2. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

3. Extracts only the variables on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

4. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

5. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names

6. From the data set in step 5, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

The results have been saved into a file called 'uci_har_grp_means.txt' for ease of reference.
